# Advanced Command & Control (C2) Server

## Project Overview

This Command and Control (C2) server is a sophisticated network administration tool designed for remote system management, security testing, and system administration tasks. Built with Python, it offers both command-line and graphical user interfaces, providing flexibility for different operational scenarios. The system establishes a secure communication channel between a central server and multiple client agents deployed on remote machines.

## Architecture

The project follows a client-server architecture with the following components:

1. **C2 Server (Server-side)**
   - Centralized control interface
   - Multi-client connection management
   - Command routing and response handling
   - File transfer operations
   - Available in both CLI and GUI variants

2. **C2 Agent (Client-side)**
   - Lightweight client that runs on target systems
   - Maintains persistent connection to the server
   - Executes commands received from the server
   - Implements features like file transfers, screenshots, and shell access
   - Automatic reconnection capabilities

3. **Cryptographic Utilities**
   - Provides encryption for secure communications
   - Protects data in transit between server and agents

## Key Features

### Multi-Client Connection Handling
- Concurrent connection management for multiple agents
- Unique identification for each connected client
- Real-time status monitoring of all connections
- Selection mechanism for targeting specific clients

### Remote Command Execution
- Execute system commands on remote machines
- Capture and return command output to the server
- Support for complex command sequences
- Error handling and timeout management

### File Transfer Capabilities
- Bidirectional file transfer between server and agents
- Upload files to remote systems
- Download files from remote systems
- Progress tracking for large file transfers
- Integrity verification

### Screenshot Functionality
- Capture screen content from remote systems
- Transfer images back to the server
- Option to save screenshots with timestamps
- Configurable screenshot quality

### Interactive Reverse Shell
- Establish interactive command shell on remote systems
- Real-time command input and output
- Support for complex interactive applications
- Session management for multiple shell instances

### User Interface Options
- Command-line interface for scripting and automation
- Graphical user interface for easier management
- Real-time log display
- Client selection and management tools
- Intuitive command execution interface

### Resilience and Reliability
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Timeout management for unresponsive clients
- Graceful disconnection capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### Networking
- Socket-based TCP communication
- Custom protocol for command and data exchange
- Connection pooling and management
- Network error detection and handling

### Multi-threading
- Concurrent client handling
- Background operations for file transfers
- Non-blocking UI during long-running operations
- Thread synchronization for shared resources

### Security Features
- Optional encrypted communications
- Authentication mechanisms
- Session management
- Configurable connection parameters

### Cross-Platform Support
- Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS targets
- Adaptive command execution based on target OS
- Platform-specific feature implementations when required

## Usage Guidelines

### Server Deployment
```
# Start the command-line server
python c2_server.py [host] [port]

# Start the GUI server
python c2_server_gui.py
```

### Agent Deployment
```
# Deploy agent with default connection to localhost
python c2_agent.py

# Deploy agent with custom server address
python c2_agent.py [server_ip] [server_port]
```

### Basic Command Reference
- `help`: Display available commands
- `list`: Show connected clients
- `select <id>`: Select a client by ID
- `upload <src> <dst>`: Upload a file to the client
- `download <src> <dst>`: Download a file from the client
- `screenshot [path]`: Take a screenshot on the client
- `shell`: Start an interactive shell session
- `exit`: Disconnect from the current client
- `quit`: Shut down the C2 server

## Security Considerations

This C2 server is a powerful tool that can be used for legitimate system administration and security testing purposes. However, it's important to note that:

1. Authorization should always be obtained before deploying agents on any system
2. Communications should be encrypted when operating over untrusted networks
3. Access to the server interface should be properly secured
4. All activities should comply with relevant laws and regulations

## Future Enhancements

- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- Enhanced authentication mechanisms
- Support for proxied connections
- Plugin system for extended functionality
- Web-based administration interface
- Detailed activity logging and auditing features
- Advanced evasion techniques for security testing
